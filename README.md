# book_reviews
This repository contains the reviews of books that I read

Grandparents bag of stories - This book was amazing. I mean so many stories it's like wonderland for a child. I reccomend this book to all children 

The dog bible - Yeah, that sounds odd, like why did I read a book on dogs ?! But I mean if you have/getting a dog this book is a must. I reccomend this book to dog owners or to be dog owners 

ETL Books - These books helped me learn so so much like about flowers, airplanes and a lot more. I reccomend these books to children at the age of 5 to 11

The worlds greatest writers - This book told me about many famous writers. This book is OK for a child. I reccomend this book to children and adults
